This is a collection of python-scripts/-programs I work on from time to time.

BLOCK is a short script that takes a screenshot and displays it fullscreen, thus "blocking" the screen. (Finished, but may be expanded in the future)

CALENDAR is a script that creates a calender that fits on a single DinA4-page. One can specify holidays and birthdays within a .txt file, these days will be colored.The script creates a .tex-file full of tikz-code, which is compiled to pdf by pdflatex. (Finished, but may be expanded in the future)

MANDALAS is becoming a script to creates mandala-like circular patterns. A lot of work in progress.

STARMAKER is a script to create recursive (pseudo-fractal) stars of colored lines. Depending on a large set of parameters, a lot of different outputs are possible. Parameters are given by an init-file (see starmaker/Init). For example outputs, see starmaker/Example_Output. (Almost finished, some functionalities not yet implemented. May be expanded in the future.)
