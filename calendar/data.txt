# example data file:
# usage:
#
# lines beginning with '#' are ignored by programm
# lines beginning with '+' mark the beginning of one of three topics:
#
# +Holiday:Personal
# +Holiday:Public
# +Anniversary
#
# holidays induce a color-filled day (personal: blue, public: green)
# anniversaries induce a mark at the specific date
# anniversaries can be linked with a note (see below)
# 
# to specify dates, the month has to be given first:
# lines beginning with 'm:' or 'M:' specify a month, which holds for all following dates untill another month is given. The month is specified by its number (1-12)
# 
# Example (sets month to april):
# m: 4
#
# When a topic and a month is specified, dates can be given by simply writing the days of the month, one per line. Alternatively, a range of dates can be given by seperating first and last day with '-'.
# Dates can have a comment within the same line, by adding ':' after the day (or days). For Anniversaries, these comments may appear on the calendar in a later version.
#
# Note: use only basic latin letters
